# You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters
# long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have different
# heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by a
# zero-indexed array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall
# from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the
# height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
#
# The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such
# blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks
# needed to build the wall.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(h)
#
# that, given a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers specifying the
# height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
#
# For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
#
#   H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
#   H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
#   H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
# the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of
# seven blocks.
#
# Assume that:
#
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
# Complexity:
#
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not
# counting the storage required for input arguments).
#
# Elements of input arrays can be modified.
